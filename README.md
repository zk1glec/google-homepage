# google-homepage
This is a project from The Odin Project. I'm to build a replica Google Home page

I'm starting this project on 1/20/2020 at 10:25 PM and will update when I complete this project. 

 
 Project finished per instructions on 1/22/2020 at 3:00 AM. 
 
- I was able to change the radius of the searh bar to give it a similar look to the origional google homepage.
- I learned alot about margins and paddings to get everything where it needed to go. 
- I learned more ahout debugging when looking at the homepage and something wasnt functioning properly. 
- I utilized the developer tool for Chrome with the 'inspect' tool. Though it was helpful in some ways, google helped more. 
- I leanred alot of new things inside CSS which was alot of fun and makes you appreciate all the little functions of the web. 

Over all. this was alot of fun making this project. I did do what the instructions said NOT to do and was a bit of a perfectionist on this project but it seems to be the most effective way for me to learn. 

The idea crossed me to customize the page more after it was complete but im eager to get back to the Odin Project and start learning some real coding!
